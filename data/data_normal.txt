The old man rode the boat .
The prime number was difficult to derive .
Fat people eat healthy too .
The cotton clothing was better for her skin .
The male ducks are out on weekends .
I convinced her children to quiet down .
The old train left the station .
The complex houses have an intricate design .
The fruit flies surrounded the mold .
The young dog jumped around .
He hummed while washing the dishes .
Jay always jogs a mile .
The horse raced past the barn .
The government plans to raise taxes .
The ugly face was beautiful .
The sour milk was expired .
The tuna can was easy to open .
The man returned to his house .
The brave guard was valiant .
The man who whistles tunes is very loud .
The night wind was pleasant .
The top vote was undeserving .
