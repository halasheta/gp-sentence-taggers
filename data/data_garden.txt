The old man the boat .
The prime number few .
Fat people eat accumulates in their body .
The cotton clothing is made of grows in Africa .
The male ducks out on weekends .
I convinced her children are noisy .
The old train the young .
The complex houses married and single students .
The fruit flies when it is thrown .
The young dog old traditions .
While he was washing the dishes fell .
Since Jay always jogs a mile seems short .
The horse raced past the barn fell .
The government plans to raise taxes were defeated .
The ugly face the beautiful . 
The sour milk the situation .
The man returned to his house was happy .
The brave guard freedom .
The man who whistles tunes pianos .
The night winds nocturnal animals .
The top vote for their group .
